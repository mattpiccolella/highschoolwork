This repository holds the code for the two websites I created for organizations in my high school, Point Pleasant Borough
High School. While in high school, I was president of both clubs, and used my skills in computer science to add to the 
clubs by creating these websites. I now serve as a moderator for both sites, assisting the newly elected webmaster. In
addition, there is some assorted code from other things that I did while in my APCS class.
